<h1>Post-it</h1>

This was a school project me and a friend worked on where the assignment was to come up with an app idea that we would build in Vue. Some requirements for the app was to use CRUD operations and to be able to create accounts and log in and out. 

The application we created was named Post-It. 

We wanted to create a mindful place online where users could share their thoughts and get inspired and motivated by each other. To avoid comparing ourselves to others, which often makes us feel bad, we have chosen not to include a like button, and no images can be uploaded. Instead the app is working like this:

You can create an account and log in to your homepage. Inside the application you can create simple messages and put them in different categories such as "motivation", "anxiety", "overwhelm" or "heartbroken". These messageses are posted on the page for others to read - just like post-it notes!

You can see all posts or filter the posts according to the different categories named above. 

I'm very proud of this project as it was challenging to implement and build the application,furthermore I'm really proud about the idea we came up with 
and the design and final outcome!
